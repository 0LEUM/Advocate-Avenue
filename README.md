### 🙌Overview 

- In the landing page ,the user will have two options: the "Login" button through which if the user who has already registered will be able to login and the "Register" button through which not only the user but also the advocate  will first register. 

After the login/ registration:
 * The user automatically gets access to all the advocates  within their desired state and locality if those advocates are registered to our website.
 * The advocates register to this website  as it acts as a bridge between the clients and the advocates which will bring more clients to them.

 - We also have the "About Us"and "Contact Us" section which tells us about the whole website in brief and redirects to the "Contact Us" page if anyone needs any sort of help or assistance, respectively.



### 💀 Challenges we ran into:

* Integration Complexity:
    * Challenge: Ensuring smooth integration among MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js may pose complexities, requiring meticulous coordination.
* Scalability:
    * Challenge: Ensuring the system's scalability as the project expands, demanding careful architecture and optimization considerations.
* Security Concerns:
    * Challenge: Addressing security vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection, and implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Real-time Functionality:
    * Challenge: Implementing and managing real-time features, such as WebSocket connections, can be complex and might necessitate additional technologies.
* State Management in React:
    * Challenge: Efficiently managing state in a growing React application, potentially utilizing state management libraries like Redux.
* Deployment and Hosting:
    * Challenge: Overcoming deployment challenges, including server configuration, load balancing, and optimizing for production environments.
* Learning Curve:
    * Challenge: Managing the learning curve associated with the MERN stack, especially if the development team is not already familiar with these technologies.
* CORS Issues:
    * Challenge: Handling CORS issues, particularly when dealing with separate frontend and backend domains, may require precise configuration.
* Version Compatibility:
    * Challenge: Ensuring compatibility among different versions of MongoDB, Node.js, React, and other dependencies to maintain stability.
* Testing:
    * Challenge: Implementing comprehensive testing for all MERN stack components to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application.

 
### 🔮 What's Next For Our Project:

- Figuring out a way, by which we can make the process of verifying lawyers effective and quick, as in India there  is no website which can tell a lawyer is a legit or not.

- Optimization and minor bug fixes

- Building a  chatroom using webrtc and socket.io so that the lawyer can interact with the client seamlessly.
